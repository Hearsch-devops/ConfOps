🚀 My Latest DevOps Project – Conference Room Booking System!

I built a fully responsive Conference Room Booking Application leveraging AI-assisted prompt engineering with Clude.ai, and implementing workflow automation using n8n. This project integrates frontend, backend, automation, and observability into one seamless system.

✨ Highlights:

🖥️ Responsive HTML/CSS/JS frontend

🧠 Flask (Python) API with PostgreSQL

⚙️ Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, GitLab CI/CD

✉️ Automation: Triggering email confirmations to users and Slack notifications to the team via n8n workflows

💾 Features:

Real-time room availability

Dynamic price calculation

One-time booking modification via Booking ID

Instant reservation alerts
